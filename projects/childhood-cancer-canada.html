        <div class="heading">Childhood Cancer Canada</div>
        <div class="text-block add-margin">Childhood Cancer Canada (CCC) is a national-level nonprofit org dedicated to supporting cancer research and childhood cancer families and patients through non-medical funding. As a small-sized organization with limited staff and resources, <strong>its website is its face, brand, and main source of impact</strong>.<br /></div>
        <div class="h2 section-heading">While the website was mostly functional, major organizational changes during the pandemic had left it fragmented and unpolished.</div>
        <div class="subsubheading">Context</div>
        <div class="text-block">This is a real project for a real client and was facilitated by the capstone course of my master&#x27;s program. Although the course requirements were predetermined, we consciously avoided confining ourselves to them and instead <strong>strived to maximize the value we could provide to the client</strong> within the allotted timeframe.<br /><br /><strong>Our team of 5 worked on this project from January 2023 - April 2023</strong></div>
        <div class="subsubheading">my contributions</div>

        <div class="text-block"><strong>UX Researcher<br />‍</strong>Additionally, I was involved during the analysis phases of secondary &amp; primary research and helped in conducting formative evaluations of our redesign&#x27;s prototypes.</div>

        <h2 class="h2 section-heading">Tapping into our client&#x27;s experiences</h2>
        <div class="text-block">The kick-off had shed some light on the challenge before us, but in order to learn more about the organization, the people behind it, and their own struggles with the website, we decided to conduct <strong>one-on-one semi-structured stakeholder interviews with the 4 main staff members</strong> of the CCC team. </div>
        <div class="subsubheading">two main user groups</div>
        <div class="text-block">The website was mainly targeted towards <strong>Donors (current and potential)</strong> who are the main source of funding for the organization, and <strong>Social/Healthcare workers</strong> who acted as a bridge between the organisation and people impacted by childhood cancer.</div>
        <div class="h2 highlight">&quot;There is a limited pool of donation money that is being distributed between various organizations. A good website would give us credibility and help our donation base grow.&quot;<br /><span class="quote-source">- Staff Member</span></div>
        <div class="subsubheading">prevalent functional issues</div>
        <div class="text-block">The staff members were well aware of the challenges faced by visitors. This was mostly because the simplest way for visitors to overcome these difficulties was to directly contact the staff through email or phone. However, this presented an additional burden on the already lean team of CCC.</div>
        <div class="h2 highlight">&quot;Visitors would call us and say, &#x27;I was trying to fill this form but it&#x27;s not doing anything,&#x27; so I&#x27;d have to manually submit their form on the backend.&quot;<br /><span class="quote-source">- Staff Member</span></div>
        <div class="subsubheading">desired communication outcomes</div>
        <div class="text-block">In addition to the potential functional issues, we were able to distil insights from internal stakeholder interviews to define the following communication goals for the redesigned website:</div>
        <ul role="list" class="text-block-list">
          <li class="text-block-list-item"><strong>Inform </strong>website visitors of the organization&#x27;s research support efforts</li>

          <li class="text-block-list-item"><strong>Provide </strong>information on the various funding programs<br /></li>

        <h2 class="h2">Discoveries &amp; Surprises</h2>
        <div class="text-block">Armed with the preliminary findings, we launched a survey to <strong>200 past donors, 50 social workers, and 200 randomly picked newsletter subscribers</strong> to collect demographic and attitudinal data on our users. On completion, participants were given the <strong>option to register for a 30 minute semi-structured interview</strong> to help us gain a nuanced understanding of their individual experiences.</div>
        <div class="subsubheading">uh oh...</div>
        <div class="text-block">Turns out we had grossly overestimated the response rates to for the survey. <strong>A total of only 6 people responded to the survey</strong> with 2 social workers and 1 donor expressing interest for participation in our interviews.</div>
        <div class="text-block">This was a big blow to our primary research plans, and we were already operating within super strict timelines.</div>
